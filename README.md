## Description

iOS Application that allows users to make searches for location and present the results in a list, allowing them to be presented in a map view inside the app. Places can be stored and deleted.

## Design Patterns

- MVC
- Decorator (Category)
- Singleton
- Facade (RestKitmanager class)
- Fast Enumeration
- Observation (NSNotification)

## Installation

Download the project to your local repository and run "pod install".
The MAPS_API_KEY is refrenced to the app id "com.mapsdemo.app", other app ids won't load the map view properly.
